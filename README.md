Change iOS Safari's Default Search Engine

1. Turn on Extension
2. Go to Safari's preferences, change search engine to Ecosia

Now Safari will use Startpage as the default search engine.

To change search engine, change 'www.startpage.com' (from iOSSafariDefaultSearch Extension/Resources/content.js) to other URL.
